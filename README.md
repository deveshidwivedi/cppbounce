# cppbounce

This project demonstrates how to use WebAssembly (WASM) and C++ with the twr-wasm library to create a simple bouncing ball animation using 2D drawing APIs. It utilizes a C++ Canvas class that mimics the JavaScript Canvas API.
## Features
Written in C++ and compiled to WebAssembly.

Uses the twr-wasm library for 2D drawing, which provides APIs similar to the JavaScript Canvas API.

Includes a C++ canvas.cpp wrapper class to simplify interactions with WebAssembly.

Displays bouncing balls inside an HTML page using WASM.
